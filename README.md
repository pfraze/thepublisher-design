# ThePublisher project design document

Until we have a name, this project will just be called ThePublisher.

ThePublisher is intended for desktop/notebooks, but it could also be applied to servers.

## Premise

### [Market](#todo)

*need more here*

An early niche to focus on, could be electron devs.
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) is a new platform that doesn't have a store or package manager.
There's still some pain to creating the installers and autoupdaters.
But there are already [a good number of apps](http://electron.atom.io/apps/) developed.
